          <p> Carlton Banks is a character from the TV show "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." He's known for being kind of uptight and conservative, which creates a funny contrast with his cousin Will, who is more laid-back. One of the things he's really famous for is his quirky dance called the "Carlton Dance." It's a fun and memorable part of the show, and the character is played by actor Alfonso Ribeiro.
